This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup:

Follow these steps:

* `npm install`
* Create a file called `.env.local` in the root of the project
    * This file is listed in the `.gitignore`, and will be used to attach your API Key so as not to publish this to Github
    * It should look something like:
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
